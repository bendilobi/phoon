**Wim Hof style breathwork with a flavor of Zen**

`Phoon` is a free and open-source app that supports you in establishing a habit of regular Wim Hof style breathwork exercise:

- **Find and maintain your motivation** for regular practice: You set a goal of how often you want to exercise - `Phoon` keeps track of your streak and makes sure you don't miss a beat. By exercising you earn rings protecting your streak: for each ring you have, you can take a day off whenever you like. How often you get new rings depends on your practice goal (e.g. "4 times a week").
- **Practice conveniently however you like**: `Phoon` is optimized for breathwork practice while lying down with closed eyes and running the app on your smartphone - during your session, it can be operated fully with touch gestures and guides your exercise with sounds. Its touch gestures are designed to be easily operated "blindly": to go to the next step, for example, you tap anywhere on the screen with three fingers at once - this way, you won't trigger it accidentally when you pick up your phone. You prefer being guided visually? `Phoon` provides animations ("breathing bubble") and color-coded phases so you are always oriented!
- **Optimize your breathwork success**: fine-tune your exercise parameters and keep track of your retention time progress. `Phoon` provides a graph of the mean retention (breath hold) time of your last 30 sessions so you can retrace how your retention capacity develops. Tinker with your exercise parameters (such as _nummber of cycles per session_, _breathing speed_ or _number of breaths_) to find the setup that works best for you!

## Other features
- Unsure whether you have enough time to do an exercise before leaving to work? Based on you previous retention times and your exercise settings, `Phoon` calculates at which time you will probably be done.
- Not enough time to do a full exercise? Quickly adjust the number of cycles you want to do in your session without changing your general exercise preferences.
- Data export: You can export your retention and streak data in JSON format
